# What is BKLYN Incubator?

BKLYN Incubator is a program developed by [Brooklyn Public Library](http://www.bklynlibrary.org/). The Incubator draws its format from the incubator models in the tech sector, but instead of incubating early stage startups, it incubates innovative programs by providing resources, mentorship, and funding to public service staff who work directly with patrons of the 5th largest library system in the country.  The purpose of BKLYN Incubator is to build the public programs and services from the ground up and support ideas that are responsive to the communities that house the 59 branches of the Brooklyn Public Library system.  Additionally, the Incubator opens new channels of communication from the public service staff to the administration so that problem areas can be identified, new programs can be tested, and innovative staff members can receive support and recognition for implementing changes that shape the future of the Library.

# Incubator Web Tool

Brooklyn Public Library partnered with [Bureau Blank](http://bureaublank.com/), a NYC-based technology and digital design organization, to create an open source web-based Drupal application called the Incubator Web Tool. This tool allows staff to submit ideas for projects, allows for public comment, and houses all of the final evaluations from Incubator applicants in an idea bank.  The submission form requests basic information about the team, program, budget, and audience but also requires applicants to identify the community need that their proposed program would help address, how their idea aligned with the Libraryâ€™s strategic priorities, any potential solutions for anticipated challenges, and the metrics for success.  Applicants also have the opportunity to submit any work they have done to develop their idea including research, planning documents, and timelines that might indicate their aptitude and potential to succeed.
